## What it shows

### Foundation

- **Courvux 0.7.1** mounted inside a Tauri WebView, with reactive computed properties, `cv-if`/`cv-else-if`/`cv-for`, two-way `cv-model`, and `@event` handlers — all the reactivity an editor UI needs without an external state manager.
- **`courvux-precompile` Vite plugin** active — every template expression is compiled to a JS arrow function at build time, so the runtime never calls `new Function`. The Tauri `tauri.conf.json` ships `script-src 'self'` and the `<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy">` in `index.html` matches; no `unsafe-eval` anywhere.
- **Tailwind 4** via `@tailwindcss/vite`. Single `@import "tailwindcss"` in `src/style.css`, no config file.
- **Lucide icons** throughout the UI — toolbar, sidebar header, settings panel, file tree — bundled as static SVG strings via a tiny `lucideToSvg()` helper so re-renders are free.

### Two top-level modes

The app boots into one of two modes, switchable from the **File** menu:

- **Library mode** — the original flat notes folder owned by the app. Notes live as `<id>-<slug>.md` files with a YAML frontmatter block (`title`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`); the slug suffix keeps filenames recognizable when you open the folder in your own file manager.
- **Project mode** — open an arbitrary folder anywhere on disk and edit its `.md` files **in place**. No slug rename, no frontmatter wrapping — the project stays usable in any other editor, in git, in static-site generators.

The chosen mode + last opened project are persisted across launches.

### Library mode

- **Markdown editing + live preview** via [`marked`](https://marked.js.org/) → [`DOMPurify`](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify). Three view modes — **Edit / Split / Preview** — cycle with `Ctrl+P`. The preview pane is fully sanitized so a hostile paste can't execute scripts even with strict CSP.
- **One Markdown file per note** at `<notes-dir>/<id>-<slug>.md`. Frontmatter on top, raw Markdown body below. Open in any editor, sync with Dropbox / Syncthing / git, no proprietary store.
- **Save state machine.** New notes start `unsaved` and require `Ctrl+S` (or the Save button) for the first commit. After that, every keystroke promotes the note to `dirty` and auto-saves 600 ms later. Status bar shows `○ Unsaved` / `● Saving…` / `✓ Saved`.
- **Sidebar search** (`Ctrl+F`) — case-insensitive, title-only filter against the recency-sorted list. Body search is intentionally *not* implemented — that would force loading every `.md` from disk on every keystroke. A future Rust-side advanced search can do that on demand.
- **Custom notes folder.** Settings panel (gear icon, `Ctrl+,`) lets the user pick any folder on disk as the notes location via the native folder picker. Choice persists in `<app-data>/courvux-tauri-notepad/config.json` along with the auto-save preference. "Reset to default" reverts.

### Project mode

- **Native folder picker** opens any directory as a project. Project root + recents are persisted in `config.json`; the welcome screen lists recents so re-opening is one click.
- **Tree sidebar** with chevron expand/collapse per directory and per-kind icons (folder / `.md` / image / other). Hidden files and a denylist of noisy directories (`node_modules`, `target`, `.git`, `dist`, `.venv`, …) are skipped; recursion is capped at depth 10 / 5000 entries to keep huge repos safe to open.
- **Edit `.md` in place** with the same Markdown editor as library mode. Atomic tmp + fsync + rename writes. The auto-save scheduler snapshots the active mode + key (note id or file path) so a switch never lets a stale write fire against the wrong target.
- **Image preview modal.** Click any image entry in the tree to view it inline in a backdrop modal — Esc / click-outside dismisses.
- **Inline image rendering** in the Markdown preview. `![alt](images/foo.jpg)` resolves relative to each file's parent directory and serves through Tauri's `asset://` protocol; the project root is granted to the asset scope on open.
- **Create files / folders.** "+ New" opens an in-app modal asking for a name; `notes/2026/draft.md` creates the chain then the file, a trailing `/` makes the entry folder-only. "+ Folder" runs the same flow, folder-only. Each `/`-segment is sanitized individually so a name like `docs:bad/intro.md` becomes `docsbad/intro.md` instead of losing the slash. The modal replaces `window.prompt()` because WKWebView (macOS) deliberately strips it for security and would silently return null.
- **Select a folder as the "+ New" target.** Click any folder in the tree to mark it as the create target — the next `+ New File` / `+ Folder` lands inside that folder instead of the project root. Click the same folder again, or click the project name in the sidebar header, to deselect and fall back to root. Clicking a file (md or image) auto-selects its parent so consecutive creates stay next to whatever you're currently working on. The modal hint always tells you where the entry will land.

### Native menu bar

Tauri's platform-native menu, wired in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` setup:

- **File** — New Note (`Ctrl+N`) · Open File… (`Ctrl+O`) · Open Folder… (`Ctrl+Shift+O`) · Close Project (`Ctrl+Shift+W`) · Save (`Ctrl+S`) · Save As… (`Ctrl+Shift+S`) · Export PDF… (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) · Export Project as PDF… (`Ctrl+Shift+E`) · Quit
- **Edit** — Undo · Redo · Cut · Copy · Paste · Select All

Edit-menu items use Tauri's `PredefinedMenuItem` so they trigger the focused element's native handler without an IPC bounce — `<textarea>` and `<input>` get working keyboard menus on every OS for free.

### `.md` file association

`bundle.fileAssociations` in `tauri.conf.json` registers `.md` and `.markdown` (mime: `text/markdown`) so the installed app shows up as a handler in the file manager. Linux builds (`.deb` / `.rpm` / `.appimage`) pick this up via the generated `.desktop` MimeType entry.

`tauri-plugin-single-instance` (registered first, per its docs) forwards every double-click of a `.md` file to the running notepad instead of launching a fresh window. The handler raises + focuses the existing main window, then imports the path into the active notes folder via the same code path as `File → Open File`.

### PDF export

Two flows:

- **Export PDF** (single file, `Ctrl+Shift+P`) — flips to preview view and calls `window.print()`. Print CSS hides every chrome surface and reflows the rendered Markdown to a clean black-on-white page. **Caveat**: WebKit2GTK's print pipeline does not preserve `<a href>` link annotations on Linux, so links in the resulting PDF are visible but not clickable.
- **Export Project as PDF** (`Ctrl+Shift+E`) — bundles every `.md` in the project into a single PDF generated with [`jsPDF`](https://github.com/parallax/jsPDF). A hand-walked DOM walker emits headings, paragraphs, lists, code blocks, blockquotes, and images one element at a time, **with real PDF link annotations**:
  - `https://…` → URI annotation (clickable in any reader)
  - `[other](other.md)` → resolved against the project's path map and emitted as a PageJump annotation pointing at that file's first page
  - Each section starts on its own page, prefixed by its path-from-root as a colored title
  - jsPDF chunk (~600 KB with html2canvas pulled in by its bundle) is dynamically imported on first export, so the main app payload stays at ~250 KB

### UI polish

- **Window state persistence** via `tauri-plugin-window-state` — size, position, maximized, fullscreen all restored across launches.
- **Collapsible + resizable sidebar.** Drag the right edge to resize (180 px – 480 px); toggle visibility from the toolbar or `Ctrl+B`. Width and open state both persist in `localStorage`.
- **About dialog** (`Ctrl+I`) — version (read from `package.json` at build time so it can't drift), license, source link. External links go through `tauri-plugin-opener` so they open in the OS default browser instead of no-oping inside the sandboxed webview.
- **Window-close guard.** `beforeunload` blocks accidental quit while the current note is `unsaved` or `dirty`.
- **Migration from v0.1.0.** A legacy `notes.json` blob in the app-data directory is read once on startup, written out as one `.md` file per entry, and the old file is removed.

## Dev

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm tauri:dev
```

The first build compiles all of Tauri + the platform's webview bindings (WebKit GTK on Linux, WebView2 on Windows, WKWebView on macOS) and takes a few minutes; subsequent runs are seconds. Hot module reload works for both `src/main.js` and `src/style.css`; Rust changes inside `src-tauri/` trigger a re-link, not a full rebuild.

## Prerequisites

Common to every platform:

- **Node 18+** (`node --version`)
- **pnpm** (`pnpm --version`) — `npm install -g pnpm` if missing
- **Rust toolchain** — `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`

### Linux (Fedora 40+)

```bash
sudo dnf install -y \
    webkit2gtk4.1-devel \
    openssl-devel \
    curl wget file \
    libappindicator-gtk3-devel \
    librsvg2-devel \
    patchelf \
    rpm-build
```

### Linux (Debian / Ubuntu)

```bash
sudo apt install -y \
    libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev \
    build-essential curl wget file \
    libxdo-dev libssl-dev libayatana-appindicator3-dev \
    librsvg2-dev patchelf
```

### macOS

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

That ships everything Tauri needs (Clang, the macOS SDK, `codesign` for ad-hoc signatures during local builds).

### Windows

1. Install [Microsoft C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) — pick the "Desktop development with C++" workload.
2. **WebView2** is preinstalled on Windows 11 and recent Windows 10 updates. If your build target is older, install the [Evergreen runtime](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/webview2/).
3. Optional bundling tools (only needed for installer artifacts): the build downloads NSIS / WiX automatically on first run.

## Build a release binary

```bash
pnpm tauri:build
```

Outputs land in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`:

| Platform | Bundle types Tauri produces |
|---|---|
| Linux   | `appimage/*.AppImage`, `deb/*.deb`, `rpm/*.rpm` |
| macOS   | `dmg/*.dmg`, `macos/*.app` |
| Windows | `msi/*.msi`, `nsis/*-setup.exe` |

The `bundle.targets` array in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` controls which formats to build. Currently set to `["appimage", "rpm", "deb"]` for the Linux Fedora-targeted host that produced this repo's first release; on macOS / Windows the CLI ignores Linux-only targets and emits the platform-native ones automatically.

To register the `.md` file association on Linux, install the produced package:

```bash
sudo dnf upgrade src-tauri/target/release/bundle/rpm/*.rpm
xdg-mime default dev.vanjex.courvux-tauri-notepad.desktop text/markdown
```

### Fedora 40+ AppImage gotcha

`linuxdeploy` ships an old `strip` binary inside its AppImage that doesn't recognize the `.relr.dyn` section type emitted by glibc on Fedora 40+. The build crashes mid-bundle with `unknown type [0x13] section .relr.dyn`. Skip the strip step (the system libraries are already stripped):

```bash
NO_STRIP=true pnpm tauri:build
```

Same workaround applies to other rolling-release distros that ship a recent glibc (Arch, openSUSE Tumbleweed). Debian / Ubuntu typically ship an older glibc and don't hit this.

### Cross-platform note

A Tauri build always produces artifacts for the **host** platform. To ship for Linux + macOS + Windows you need three machines (or three GitHub Actions runners) — there's no cross-compile story for the webview side. The Rust side cross-compiles fine, but the bundled webview can't.

If you want releases for all three from a single push, the standard pattern is a `release.yml` workflow with three matrix jobs (`ubuntu-latest`, `macos-latest`, `windows-latest`), each running `pnpm tauri:build` and uploading its artifact.

## How the precompiler works here

`vite.config.js` registers `courvux/plugin/precompile` ahead of any other transform. The plugin walks every `.js` module looking for `template:` properties whose value is a static string or template literal with no `${}` interpolations. For each one, it extracts every Courvux template expression — `{{ ... }}`, `:attr="..."`, `@event="..."`, `cv-X="..."` — and rewrites them through the [`courvux-precompiler`](https://github.com/vanjexdev/courvux-precompiler) WASM module into JS arrow functions. The compiled functions are inserted as a sibling `exprs:` property on the same component config; the runtime checks this map before falling back to `new Function`.

For this app, the build report reads:

```
[courvux-precompile] processed 1 file(s), 134 expression(s) precompiled, 0 template(s) fell back to runtime new Function.
```

Zero fallbacks → the runtime never has to call `new Function`, and the strict `script-src 'self'` CSP holds.

## Storage locations

**Library notes** (`<app-data>/courvux-tauri-notepad/notes/<id>-<slug>.md`):

```
$XDG_DATA_HOME/dev.vanjex.courvux-tauri-notepad/notes/
# typically:
~/.local/share/dev.vanjex.courvux-tauri-notepad/notes/
```

The footer of the sidebar shows the resolved storage path. Each note is one Markdown file; the slug suffix is derived from the title for human readability when you open the folder in another editor.

**App config** — same parent directory, `config.json`:

```json
{ "notesDir": null, "autoSave": true, "recentProjects": [...] }
```

`notesDir` overrides the default notes location; `recentProjects` is the most-recently-opened-folders list shown on the welcome screen.

**Window state** — `<app-data>/courvux-tauri-notepad/window-state.json`, managed by `tauri-plugin-window-state`.

**Project mode files** — wherever the user opened them. The app never copies project files to its own data dir; they stay in their original location.

`app_data_dir()` respects the bundle identifier from `tauri.conf.json`, so two installs of different bundles never share state.
